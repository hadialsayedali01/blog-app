# Blog App

A simple blogging application that stores and deletes created blogs in a MongoDB database, intended as a personal learning exercise. The app uses mongoose to manage the database. 

> [!NOTE]
> Running this app requires that you [create a database in MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database). Alternatively, you can watch a demonstration of this app [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFTT4BIuQQA&ab_channel=HadiAli).

## Steps

1. To install all dependencies, run ```$ npm install```.

2. Create a MongoDB database, as mentioned in the note. Paste your connection string to this database into line 11 of app.js where indicated.

3. Run ```$ nodemon app``` or ```$ node app.js```.

4. Visit http://localhost:3000/.
